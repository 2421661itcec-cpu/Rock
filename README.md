## 🎯 Key Exhibition & Gameplay Features

### 1. 🤖 On-Device AI Hand Tracking
- Powered by Google MediaPipe Tasks Vision (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision@0.10.14`).
- **100% On-Device Privacy:** Video frames are analyzed locally in the client browser using WebAssembly (WASM) and WebGL. No video is ever recorded, uploaded, or transmitted.
- **Neon Skeleton Overlay:** Real-time visual overlay displaying hand landmark points and connecting bones directly on the camera preview.

### 2. 🕹️ Five Playable Game Modes
- **Quick Match:** Fast exhibition blitz — first challenger to score 2 wins takes the match.
- **Best of 5:** Classic tournament standard — first to 3 wins or highest score after 5 rounds.
- **Survival Mode:** Endless gauntlet — continue playing until your first defeat. Draws keep you alive! Tracks the ultimate survival streak.
- **Time Attack:** 60-second high-energy clock countdown — score as many wins as possible before the timer runs out.
- **Practice Mode:** Free-play with real-time feedback, landmark skeleton overlay, and gesture tips without affecting competitive stats.

### 3. 🧠 Transparent AI Opponent Strategies
- **Easy (Cyber Trainee):** Uniform random decision-making. Beginner friendly.
- **Normal (Cyber Tactician):** Incorporates classic game-theoretic psychological modeling (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift tendency anticipation) combined with 40% tactical randomization.
- **Hard (Cyber Overlord - Boss Mode):** Analyzes human move frequency and anti-repetition patterns across the match, wrapped in an aggressive red/magenta Boss UI with tactical counter-moves.
- *Notice: Strictly non-cheating and transparent — AI moves are computed independently without looking ahead at camera frames!*

### 4. 🔊 Audio Synthesizer & Speech Announcer
- **Web Audio API Synth:** Procedurally generated 8-bit cyber sounds for countdown beeps, laser shoot sting, winning fanfare, defeat tones, and achievement chimes. Completely offline-capable with zero external MP3 dependencies.

- Independent SFX & Voice toggles, plus a master volume control.

### 5. 📈 XP, Levels, and 8 Unlockable Achievements
- Gain XP for every round played (+50 XP for Win, +20 XP for Draw, +10 XP for Loss, bonus for high difficulty and comebacks).

## 🎓 College Fest Exhibition Tips

1. **Dual Display / Large Monitor:** Connect the laptop running the game to a large booth TV or external monitor and press `F` to enter **Fullscreen Mode**.
2. **Lighting:** For best hand tracking, ensure the player's hand is well-lit from the front, avoiding harsh backlight or pointing the camera directly toward halogen floodlights.
3. **Distance:** Instruct players to hold their hand roughly 1.5 to 3 feet from the webcam lens with an open palm facing forward.
4. **Mobile Sharing:** Go to **🎪 Booth Info**, input your local Wi-Fi IP address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:8000`), and display the dynamic QR code for students to test on their mobile devices!
